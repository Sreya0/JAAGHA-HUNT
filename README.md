• Agriculturalist reaps a good crop Perhaps they manage to sell all of the food quickly to
avoid losing it to waste, or they figure out how to get access to cold storage facilities to
save the stuff they can't sell right away.
• The problem is that not all farmers, especially the small ones find it difficult to find
appropriate storage facilities or can't afford them.

• The other is the possibility of fraud from the side of the storage owners or the possible
problem of constant shift in market rates of produce.
• To deal with these problems we want to create a system that can handle these issues
without third party interference.
• To create an online system connecting farmers and cold storage owners for a simple,
automating process to handle the bulk storage of perishable foods
• It is a clone of a typical online booking system with two interfaces: one for farmers and
the other for storage owners.
